# HTML Lists, Control Flow with JS, and the CSS Box Model.

## From the Duckett HTML book:

### Chapter 3: “Lists” (pp.62-73)

There are three t XX ypes of HTML lists: ordered, unordered, and definition.
 Ordered lists use numbers, Unordered lists use bullets.
 Definition lists are used to define terminology.
 Lists can be nested inside one another.

### Chapter 13: “Boxes” (pp.300-329)

CSS treats each HTML element as if it has its own box.
. You can use CSS to control the dimensions of a box.
. You can also control the borders, margin and padding for each box with CSS.
. It is possible to hide elements using the display and visibility properties.
. Block-level boxes can be made into inline boxes, and inline boxes made into block-level boxes.
. Legibility can be improved by controlling the width of boxes containing text and the leading.
. CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders.

## From the Duckett JS book:

### Review from Reading 02 - Chapter 2: “Basic JavaScript Instructions” (pp.70-73)

#### USING QUOTES INSIDE A STRING

Sometimes you will want to use a double or single quote mark within a string. Because strings can live in single or double quotes, if you just want to use double quotes in the string, you could surround the entire string in single quotes. If you just want to use single quotes in the string, you could surround the string in double quotes (as shown in the third line of this code example). You can also use a technique called escaping the quotation characters. This is done by using a backwards slash (or "backslash") before any type of quote mark that appears within a string (as shown on the fourth line of this code sample). The backwards slash tells the interpreter that the following character is part of the string, rather than the end of it. Techniques for adding content to a page are covered in Chapter 5. This example uses a property called i nnerHTML to add HTML to the page. In certain cases, this property can pose a security risk.
