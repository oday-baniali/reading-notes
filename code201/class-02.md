# HTML Text, CSS Introduction, and Basic JavaScript Instructions

## chapter 2: *text*

HTML elements are used t XX o describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
 They also provide semantic information (e.g. where emphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

## Chapter 10: Ch.10 “Introducing CSS” (pp.226-245)

CSS treats each HTML e XX lement as if it appears inside its own box and uses rules to indicate how that
element should look.
 Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that indicate what these elements should look like).
 Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
 Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties of the element that you want to change, and the values of those properties. For example, the font-family property sets the choice of font, and the value arial specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.
 CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page.

## Chapter 4: “Decisions and Loops” only up to the section on switch statements (pp.145-162)

Conditional statements allow your code to make decisions about what to do next. Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>) are used to compare two operands. Logical operators allow you to combine more than one set of comparison operators.
if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code if a condition is true, and another if it is false. switch statements allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes (and also provides a default option if none match).
Data types can be coerced from one type to another.
