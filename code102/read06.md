## COLOR
X Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
convey the mood and evokes reactions.
X There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
RGB values, hex codes, and color names.
X Color pickers can help you find the color you want.
X It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
between any text and the background color (otherwise
people will not be able to read your content).
X CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to
indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
X CSS3 also allows you to specify colors as HSL values,
with an optional opacity value. It is known as HSLA.
