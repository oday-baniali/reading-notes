# COMPARISON OPERATORS
you can evalute a situation by coparing one value on the script to what you expect it might be.
the result will be a boolean:true or false.
**==** :is equal to , **!=** :is not equal to.
## structuring comparison operators
in any condition ,there is one operator and two operands.
the operands are placed on each side of the operator. they can be values or variables.
you often see expressions enclosed in brackets like (score>=pass).
### using comparision operators
ex:    JAVASCRIPT c04/ js/ comparison-operator.js

var pass = 50; II Pass mark
var score = 90; II Score
II Check if t he user has passed
var hasPassed = score >= pass;
II Write the message i nt o the page
var el = document .getEl ementByld(' answe r ');
e 1 . t extContent = 'Leve 1 passed: ' + has Passed; 

the result will be:  level passed:true
# LOOPS
loops check condition. if it returns **true**,a code block will run.
then the conditional will be checked again and if it still returns **true**,
the code block will run again.it repeats until the condition returns **false**.
### there are three common tyoes of loops:
* For.
*While.
*Do while.
